Scanner input= new Scanner(System.in);
Scanner => it's a data type just like we have other non-primitive data types
like string we always need to have a datatype with variables in java.
input=> input is just a variable name.
new Scanner(System.in)=> creating the object of the scanner class. We create the
object of class so that we can use the code from that class.
System.in=> It tells the java that we want to capture the input from the keyboard.

why are we learning about scanner?
    so that we can learn how to handle the input from users.
Switch statement:
Pros:    1)its cleaner
         2)Its Really Fast
Cons:    1)It doesn't allow all the datatypes
         2) Switch only checks for equality it does not support >,<,!=>,=
         3) switch doesn't support logical operators || && !
